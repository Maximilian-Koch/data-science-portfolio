# Data science portfolio

This is a portfolio to demonstrate the usage of various data science methods.

1. APIs and Webscraping<br>
In this notebook, the Spotify API and Beautiful Soup are used to get and analyse the top 500 albums of all times.

2. Classification<br>
A multi-class SVM and voting ensemble are implemented from scratch and used to classify astronomical objects.

3. Clustering<br>
Different clustering algorithms are applied to cluster different types of land mines.

4. Count Data<br>
Log-linear and Poisson regression are utilised to model predictors of the usage of a bike sharing system.

5. Dimensionality Reduction<br>
PCA is used to predict landscape categories from a hyperspectral satellite image.

6. Logistic Regression<br>
This notebook applies Logistic Regression to predict whether a song is rock music or not, depending on track features.

7. NLP - Random Forest<br>
Here, NLP techniques are combined with a Random Forest to categorise news headlines.

8. NLP - Topic Modeling<br>
NLP Topic Modeling is used to get insights on how news topics evolve over time.

9. PSM<br>
In this notebook, using Propensity Score Matching the effects of family mental health history on depresison are studied.

10. Regularisation<br>
Ridge regression is demonstrated to work for certain use cases, that Linear Regression can not be applied to.

11. Time Series<br>
SARIMA modeling is us used for forecasting ice cream sales.

12. Trees<br>
Different tree, sampling and ensemble techniques are used to analyse diabetes factors.
